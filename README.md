# Translating "A Ride in Targeted Learning Territory" to Python

This repository contains the Python translation of the R code from the tutorial **[A Ride in Targeted Learning Territory](https://achambaz.github.io/tlride/1-a-ride.html)** by Antoine Chambaz. The tutorial introduces concepts and methods in targeted learning, and this project aims to replicate its functionality in Python.

### Sources Consulted

1. **Tutorial**:  
   The primary source for the R code is the tutorial itself:  
   [https://achambaz.github.io/tlride/1-a-ride.html](https://achambaz.github.io/tlride/1-a-ride.html)

2. **R Package**:  
   Some of the R code used in the tutorial is not explicitly shown. To fill in the gaps, the corresponding R package was consulted:  
   [https://github.com/achambaz/tlride/tree/master](https://github.com/achambaz/tlride/tree/master)  
   Most of the relevant R code is stored in:
   - `tlride/tlride/R/*`
   - `tlride/tlride/data/*`

### Code Structure

The Python code is organized such that:
- **Functions and Classes**: All functions and classes are defined at the top of each script.
- **Execution Block**: The actual execution of the code is written under the [`if __name__ == "__main__":`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fsuhanguo%2FDocuments%2FNJU%2F2023_0%2FCasualDeepLearning%2FDLnetworkTMLE%2F%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99%2FRide%20in%20Targeted%20Learning%2Fpython_section_1.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A155%2C%22character%22%3A3%7D%7D%5D%2C%22457e8314-a2f4-426a-90ea-918db2b41959%22%5D "Go to definition") block.

This structure allows for:
1. **Reusability**: Functions and classes can be imported and reused across different scripts.
2. **Modularity**: The code is easier to maintain and extend.

### How to Use

1. **Run the Scripts**:  
   Each script can be executed directly to replicate specific parts of the tutorial. For example:
   ```bash
   python python_section_1.py
   ```

2. **Import Functions and Classes:**
    Functions and classes can be imported into other scripts or Jupyter notebooks for further analysis. For example:
    ```bash
    from python_section_1 import Experiment
    ```

3. **Visualization**
    The code includes visualizations to replicate the plots shown in the tutorial. These are generated using matplotlib and seaborn. For example, in , the following plot is created to visualize features like ( \bar{Q}_0 ), ( Q(1,.) ), ( Q(0,.) ), and ( Q(1,.) - Q(0,.) ).

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
```bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
```

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
